# Fake Product Review Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as **genuine (good)** or **fake (claiming the product is not authentic)**.

## Dataset

The dataset contains reviews for items of various categories along with their rating.

## Methodology

We trained and evaluated three machine learning models:

-   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Best accuracy of **88.53%**.
-   **Logistic Regression:** Achieved **86.63%**.
-   **Random Forest Classifier:** Accuracy of **84.47%**.

## Features

-   Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.
-   Accuracy comparison of models.
